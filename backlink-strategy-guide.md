## Understanding Backlinks

**What are backlinks?**
Links from other websites pointing to ozorc.com. Search engines view them as "votes of confidence."

**Why they matter:**
- Improve domain authority
- Increase search rankings
- Drive referral traffic
- Build credibility and trust

**Current situation:**
- SEOptimer: 0 backlinks detected
- Seobility: 1 backlink from 1 domain
- This is a critical SEO weakness (3% score for external factors)

## Quality vs Quantity

### High-Quality Backlinks (what you want):
✅ Relevant websites (gaming, events, local Adelaide)
✅ Established domains with good authority
✅ Natural, editorial links (not paid/spammy)
✅ Dofollow links (pass SEO value)
✅ Contextual links within content

### Low-Quality Backlinks (avoid):
❌ Link farms and directories

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Local Media Pitch

```
Subject: Story Idea: Adelaide's First Old-School RPG Convention

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out with a potential story about a unique event happening in Adelaide.

On February 7th, 2026, we're hosting OZ ORC - Adelaide's first dedicated old-school
roleplaying game convention at the RSL in Colonel Light Gardens. While video games
dominate headlines, there's a thriving underground community keeping classic
tabletop gaming alive.

The "Old-School Renaissance" (OSR) movement celebrates games from the 1970s-80s,
focusing on imagination and storytelling over complex rules. We're expecting players
from across South Australia for a full day of classic D&D and OSR gaming.

Story angles:
- Nostalgia meets modern gaming culture
- Local community building around shared hobbies
- Accessible gaming for all ages and skill levels
- Revival of face-to-face gaming in a digital age

I'd be happy to arrange interviews with organizers, GMs, and attendees. We can also
provide photos from the event.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
OZ ORC Organizer
