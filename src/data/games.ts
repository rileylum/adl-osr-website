This hidden evil has been discovered by the aged wizard Ramne, who lies dying after living a magically prolonged life. But Ramne means for this one last evil to be cleansed, whether he survives it or not. You have accepted his mission to find and destroy this \"Reptile God\" once and for all... in the evil cult's swamp stronghold!\n\nThis is a trimmed and streamlined version of the Swamp Dungeon from Douglas Niles' classic module N1: Against the Cult of the Reptile God. Some additional time pressure has been incorporated into the session for convention play.\n\nWe will be playing under the BFRPG rules, which are freely available from basicfantasy.org, and pre-generated PCs will be provided.\n\nStart at the final dungeon and see whether you can defeat the reptile god!\n\nWARNING. This content comes from a classic Dungeons & Dragons module published in 1982. It includes cult themes, mind control, monstrous humanoids, parasitic influence, mild horror themes and fantasy violence in a swamp horror setting. If you have any concerns please contact the GM here on Warhorn or discuss with them on the day.",

Each player takes on a unique character with their own personality, secrets and goals. You aim is simple: achieve your objectives by any means you can.\n\nThe rules are light, success depends less on dice and more on conversation, scheming and improvisation. Negotiate, deceive, form alliances, or stab your rivals in the back.\n\nIn the end, Pigswill is a chaotic and comedic game, a perfect way to finish the evening. Stand around and socialize, have a laugh and get a taste of what a Braunstein might be like.\n\nCreator chose not to use content warnings.",

You pull your cloaks tighter around you as the rowboat cuts through the restless sea towards your destination. Then the fog clears to reveal the sinking tower rising from the water. This is the moment you have all been waiting for, the day when the enchanted stone tower said to have been built by a mad mage rises from the sea once more. It only happens once every twenty years, according to the fishermen around the inn’s warming hearth, and only stays above water for two hours. Then it sinks back into the deep along with its treasures. There is a ghostly green light glowing ominously at the top of the tower. That is where the sorcerer’s emerald is said to be. Perhaps you will be the first to find it?\n\nAbout the GM:\nI'm a relatively new GM, but I've run a number of Dragonbane sessions and have a decent grip on things at this point.\n\nPlayers:\nFeel free to familiarize yourself with the free quick-start rules, but try not to spoil the adventure in the second half of the PDF.

Through much begging, prodding, pleading, (and bribes beyond your wildest imagination), a tenuous party of the finest adventurers in the land has been assembled to try and take him down once and for all. \n\nThis is an experiment with running an OSR-style adventure at a higher level, to allow us to air out all of those spells and magic items which would normally be a bit too much for a oneshot. Expect more combat and problem-solving and less exploration - I want to focus on a handful of key encounters in the limited time we have together, rather than leaving you to fumble around in the dark. Pregens and reference materials will be provided, but if you have your own copies of the rules or a laptop, I'd highly encourage you bring those along! \n\nContent Warnings: D&D-typical adventure content, acid, grave desecration (by villains), off-screen torture (by villains)",
