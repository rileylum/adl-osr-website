        <p class="mb-6">
          OZ ORC is a day of the finest in old-school D&D and OSR gaming. We've
          dug up TTRPGs from throughout the OSR scene, from weird-punk sci-fi
          post-apocalypse to classic D&D and original-edition Dungeons &
          Dragons. We've gathered together a dozen of Adelaide's most
          experienced and capable GMs to take you through worlds of exploration,
          treasure, and death.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          No matter if you are the most grizzled grognard or you're entirely new
          to the hobby, we will have a game that will fill you with awe and
          terror.
        </p>

          Join us on February 7th, 2026 at the Colonel Light Gardens RSL for a
          day of adventure like nothing you've ever seen before, at Adelaide's
          Premier old-school gaming convention!
        </p>
        <p>
          We've started OZ ORC as a chance to bring the old-school and its
          glories to everyone in Adelaide. Everyone is welcome to bring dice,
          snacks, and their wits with them and test themselves against the
          dangers of the deepest delves. Read our <a href="/code-of-conduct" class="link link-primary">Code of Conduct</a> to learn more about our commitment to creating a welcoming environment.
