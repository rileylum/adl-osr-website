        <p class="mb-6">
          OZ ORC is a day of the finest in old-school D&D gaming. We've dug up
          TTRPGs from throughout the OSR, from weird-punk sci-fi post-apocalypse
          to the finest original-edition D&D. We've gathered together a dozen of
          Adelaide's most experienced and capable GMs to take you through worlds
          of exploration, treasure, and death.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          No matter if you are the most grizzled grognard or you're entirely new
          to the hobby, we will have a game that will fill you with awe and
          terror.
        </p>

          Join us on February 7th, 2026 at the Colonel Light Gardens RSL for a
          day of adventure like nothing you've ever seen before, at Adelaide's
          Premier old-school gaming convention!
