          <p>
            OSR stands for "Old-School Renaissance" or "Old-School Revival".
            It's a style of tabletop RPG gaming that emphasizes exploration,
            player creativity, and rulings over rules. OSR games typically
            feature high stakes, meaningful choices, and a focus on
            problem-solving rather than character builds.

            Absolutely! Our GMs are experienced at welcoming new players and
            will teach you everything you need to know. OSR games are often
            simpler in rules than modern D&D, making them perfect for beginners.
