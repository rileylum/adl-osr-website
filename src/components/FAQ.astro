            OSR stands for "Old-School Renaissance" or "Old-School Revival".
            It's a style of tabletop RPG gaming inspired by classic D&D and
            early Dungeons & Dragons editions. OSR games emphasize exploration,
            player creativity, and challenge, featuring high stakes, meaningful
            choices, and a focus on problem-solving.
