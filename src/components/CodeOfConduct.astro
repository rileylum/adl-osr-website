            OZ ORC exists to bring the glories of old-school gaming to everyone
            in Adelaide. Whether you're a grizzled grognard or entirely new to
            the hobby, everyone is welcome to bring their dice, snacks, and wits
            to test themselves against the dangers of the deepest delves.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment
            for all attendees, no matter their background or experience level.
            Our goal is to grow the hobby by ensuring everyone feels safe,
            respected, and excited to play.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Harassment, discrimination, or behavior that makes others feel
            unwelcome has no place at OZ ORC. If you experience or witness any
            issues, please speak to an organizer immediately. We will address
            all concerns seriously and take appropriate action, including
            removal from the event if necessary. Let's make this a day of
            adventure and camaraderie for all.
